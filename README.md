# GRIP_Task2-Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML


The elbow method is a heuristic used in determining the optimal number of clusters 𝑘 in a dataset for clustering analysis, such as with K-means clustering. It is based on the idea that as the number of clusters increases, the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) will decrease. The optimal number of clusters is often located at the "elbow" point in a plot of the WCSS against the number of clusters.
